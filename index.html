        <h1> About Me </h1>


        <p>Hello! I'm Artiom Asaturov, I have been part of a beutiful IT world for the past 3 years. As a part of QA team I have aquired extremely valuable skills on my way to becoming a professional developer.
            I love computers, cars, and most of all continuous growth. I enjoy challenges, as they are the best teachers you can ever find. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In my free time I like to watch movies, go to the parks, discover new ways to code via social media, Google or YouTube. 
        </p>

        <p>
            My ultimate goal is to become a Full-Stack Developer, in my eyes programming is like creating a whole new world, and one day I want to be able to create this world from scratch to finish.
        </p>

        <div>
        <h3>Why do I want to be a developer</h3>
        <p>I was born in Ukraine, which is known for its developers talents. I was growing up seeing scary, but beutifull lines of code, and I have always dreamed of being able to write them myself.
            And now, when I finally started learning JS/HTML/CSS - I realized that coding is something that I want to devote my life to. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that the coding future is going to be even more exciting, and I want to be part of that future.
        </p>
